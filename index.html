        <h1>Paragraph 1</h1>
        <p>
            After listening to the podcast of How Games Move Us, I thought it was cool that games can 
            actually touch your emotions and feelings. It’s interesting to think that it can serve as 
            an experience, for example That Dragon: cancer is a game about the experience of having a 
            child with terminal cancer. The game puts you in the parent’s shoes because you are doing 
            the chores and responsibilities they had from their perspective. I also that it was 
            interesting that <em>NASA </em> sponsored a game for people to know what the solar system 
            consist of.

        <h2> Paragraph 2</h2>
        <p>
            After watching the talk of Tanya DePass, it made me realized how minority groups are being 
            underrepresented in the game developer’s community. I did not know of this problem until I 
            saw this video. Tanya did bring up a great point of how a lot of video games have very similar 
            plots or background stories. Tanya explained the reason for this is because many game 
            developers are white men. Development teams don’t have diversity and therefore don’t have much 
            creativity beyond of their own personal experiences. The main characters of many games are 
            white males and when I think of all the games, I played in the past it shocks me how I didn’t 
            notice it before. I believe Tanya is doing a great job raising awareness and trying to get 
            underrepresent communities more opportunities to land in the industry through her organization 
            and other ones.

        <h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Sarian’s</em> article of <strong>Ethical Self-Reflection in Papers, Please</strong> explores the ethical dilemmas 
            of the game “Papers, Please” and tries to understand how people can commit atrocities. It 
            explains that people who are put in situations like the ones in the game are following orders 
            and doing their job. It explains <em>Max Weber’s</em> notion of rational authority in how politics is 
            organized in modern bureaucracies as regimented and regulated processes, forcing people to do 
            what is required of them.
